This is the codebase for our paper **Boosting Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Fine-Grained Semantic Rewards**

Please refer to the three repositories in the "**Acknowledgements**" section for environment setup. All experiments are conducted using the FineRewards-RAFT.ipynb notebook.

**Caption Reward** can be calculated using the "get_cap_reward" function.

**SAM Reward** can be calculated using the "get_sam_reward" function.
